On "terminale neutronica" computer access the three computers (MC1, MC2, MC3) which take GAMMA CAMERA MEASUREMENTS:

machine MC1: password jetjet11 
ip: 192.107.90.61

machine MC2: jetjet11
ip: 192.107.90.244

machine MC3: jetjet11
ip: 192.107.90.245


To get the data for each channel, follow the path on each machine:
Computer/C/acquisizioni/####/ ->folders 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6 (according to availability of the gamma signals) are the ones containing the data of the gamma camera channels (the order of the channels is from 1 to 4 from the inside of the tokamak chamber and then 6 and 5 as the outermost channels); copy these folders to your computer to analyse the signals

www.afs.enea.it/basilio/DPSD/  account:bespos pass:pippo

Go to DRIVERS and then SOFTWARE section and install following programs in order to be able to look at the gamma camera data directly in Windows, just by copying the channel folders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
